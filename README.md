# Meu IP
 A simple application made for discover machine's IP Address.

# Project Implementation Causes

 In my work at IT Infrastructure, in many cases we need to connect remotely
 an user's computer to solve a problem.
 But it's normal some users don't know how to discover its computer's hostname
 or IP Address.
 
 So, it would be perfect if the users could know the IP address and hostname just
 a click afar.
 
 That's why I created "Meu IP".

 
# Logbook

 Well, there was a bit of challenge for me at beginning, because I had no idea how to
 use sockets or internet testes. So at start I began studying about ping requests, and
 the java.net.DatagramSocket class.
